Note: this file reads the [arduino] serial port and can be running inside raspberry pi
(tested running raspian) while arduino with its sensors "Serial.print"s.  Since the
server is running json, the program keeps track of the major telemetry points and saves
them to an external file, which a python script (or other language's script) can later
open and post request to the server.
