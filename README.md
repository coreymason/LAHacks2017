# Dream Well

In order to have a truly healthy sleep, a lot of factors come into account. These include external temperature, room brightness, mental comfort, stress and many more. Most of the physical factors associated with sleep can be taken into account and adjusted to result in better quality sleep for people. DreamWell is an iOS app that aims to do this by monitoring your sleep by analyzing your dreams and your physical environment, and provide you with suggestions based on that to improve your sleep, and general health.

It lets you record your account of the dream, converts it into text and then runs a sentiment analysis on it. It also connects with an Arduino kit which measures your physical surroundings for temperature, humidity and brightness. It then uses this data and analyzes it against your past recordings, and gives you suggestions on how to improve your sleep quality by correspondingly tweaking your external physical conditions.
