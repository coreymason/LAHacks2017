# Dream Well

Dream Well is an iOS app that lets you keep an account of your dreams. It lets you record your account of the dream, converts it into text and then runs a sentiment analysis on it. It also connects with an Arduino kit which measures your physical surroundings for temperature, humidity and brightness. It then uses this data and analyzes it against your past recordings, and gives you suggestions on how to improve your sleep quality by correspondingly tweaking your external physical conditions.
